# Avito Frontend developer Challenge

**Author Name :** Mohamed Ait Ijja

## Project description :
The complete solution is done with pure vanilla javascript and CSS, no libraries was used during this challenge, also i tried to keep the UI as clean and minimal as possible, and rather focus more on the coding part.

To view the project you only need to open the index.html file in your prefered browser, no need for a local server or a build process.

All the core code is located in the main.js file, it's basicly a JS class with all the methods needed to show and filter the feed.
